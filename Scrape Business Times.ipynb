       "      <td>Mortgage rates have shown signs of stabilising below 6.5%, and home prices are cooling\\n\\nShare\\n\\n[ATLANTA] Pending sales of existing US homes stalled in September, suggesting anxiety about the job market kept potential buyers sidelined despite a welcome easing in mortgage rates.\\n\\nAn index of contract signings held at 74.8 after climbing a revised 4.2 per cent a month earlier to the highest level since March, according to National Association of Realtors (NAR) data released on Wednesday (Oct 29). Economists expected a 1.2 per cent increase, based on the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.\\n\\n\"A record-high stock market and growing housing wealth in September were not enough to offset a likely softening job market,\" NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said. Nonetheless, \"mortgage rates are trending towards three-year lows, which should further improve affordability, though the government shutdown could temporarily slow home sales activity\".\\n\\nEven with middling results for last month, housing economists see the resale market slowly thawing after several years of lacklustre demand. Mortgage rates have shown signs of stabilising below 6.5 per cent, and home prices are cooling.\\n\\nMoreover, the so-called \"lock-in effect\", in which homeowners resist selling because of their existing low-rate mortgages, is waning and helping to boost inventory.\\n\\nFigures out on Tuesday from S&amp;P Cotality Case-Shiller showed buyers are gaining leverage in negotiations with sellers. A national measure of home prices rose 1.5 per cent in August from a year ago, the smallest annual gain since mid-2023.\\n\\nSEE ALSO\\n\\nBy region, contract signings on previously owned homes rose 1.1 per cent in the South to the highest level since March. Pending sales also climbed in the Northeast, while falling in the West and Midwest.\\n\\nThe broader housing market has experienced more momentum recently, with new-home sales surging in August to the highest level since 2022. While some economists chalked up the sharp advance to monthly volatility, builders are using price cuts and sales incentives to drive buyer interest.\\n\\nPending home sales tend to be a leading indicator for previously owned homes, as houses typically go under contract a month or two before they are sold.

       "      <td>Located in Shenton Way, the project will be the tallest building in Singapore when completed\\n\\nShare\\n\\n[SINGAPORE] A 1,798 square foot Aman-branded residence at The Skywaters complex in Tanjong Pagar has recently changed hands at S$11.7 million or S$6,501 per square foot (psf) – marking a record-high price for a 99-year leasehold property in psf terms.\\n\\nCaveats data showed that the three-bedroom unit on the 30th floor of The Skywaters was bought by a Singapore permanent resident on Oct 8. According to a report by EdgeProp, the buyer is believed to be a Chinese national.\\n\\nLocated in Shenton Way, The Skywaters is a supertall mixed-used project which will be the tallest building in Singapore, developed by a consortium led by Perennial Holdings on the site of the former AXA Tower. Other partners include Alibaba Singapore, Chip Eng Seng, Sing-Haiyi Emerald, Piermont Holdings and HPRY Holdings.\\n\\nThe Aman-branded residence sale came just a week after the luxury hospitality operator announced its debut in Singapore at The Skywaters. Aman suites will occupy the 24th to 26th floors of the complex, with a 44-unit branded residence on the 28th to 30th floors.\\n\\nPrior to the transaction this month, the highest psf price for a 99-year leasehold property was S$6,100 psf for a 7,761 sq ft penthouse unit on the 57th floor of Skywaters Residences, a luxury condominium project located within The Skywaters project. It was bought by a foreigner, whose nationality is not known.\\n\\nTo date, a 3,089 sq ft unit at The Marq on Paterson Hill holds the record for the highest psf transaction at S$6,650 psf, in a sale sealed almost 13 years ago in November 2011.\\n\\nData from URA indicated that Skywaters Residences comprises 146 units on the 31st to 63rd storeys of The Skywaters. Grade A offices are located on the 3rd to 22nd floors. There is also a basement retail mall connected directly to Tanjong Pagar MRT station.\\n\\nThe latest sale comes on the back of improving demand for prime non-landed homes in Singapore, where steep stamp duties have curbed foreign buying since 2023.\\n\\nBased on data compiled by Huttons Asia tracking transactions of large prime location condos priced over S$5 million, 81 such units worth S$740.6 million changed hands in the third quarter of 2025 – up more than 30 per cent in terms of volume, and 30.8 per cent in terms of value quarter on quarter.\\n\\nSEE ALSO\\n\\nIn the first nine months of 2025, a total of 214 luxury non-landed homes worth S$1.9 billion were sold – an increase of 30.5 per cent in volume and 51.3 per cent in value compared with the same period a year ago.\\n\\nSome 13 transactions were valued at S$10 million and higher; among them, two units at 21 Anderson were sold to two PRs for an eye-popping S$52.25 million (S$4,999 psf) each, and a 3,057 sq ft unit in The Marq on Paterson Hill sold to a Swiss national for S$19.2 million or S$6,274 psf.\\n\\n\"The continued geopolitical tensions and uncertainties are driving many ultra-high-net-worth individuals to seek safe havens like Singapore,\" said Huttons Asia chief executive Mark Yip. \"The strong Singapore dollar further makes investing in Singapore an attractive proposition.\"\\n\\nHuttons tracked transactions of non-landed homes larger than 2,000 sq ft in the prime Core Central Region that transacted at S$5 million or more.\\n\\nOn the rental front, around 725 luxury units were leased out in Q3, up 21.6 per cent from the previous quarter.\\n\\nRents held firm, rising a marginal 1.6 per cent to S$15,599 per month. This puts rental growth for the first three quarters of 2025 at more than 10 per cent.\\n\\nYip reckons that the luxury non-landed home market may remain muted in the remaining months of this year, given year-end festivities. \"(But) on a whole, the luxury non-landed homes market is poised for its best performance since 2022,\" he said.\\n\\nCopyright SPH Media.

It was the smallest gain since mid-2023 and followed a 1.6 per cent increase in July.\\n\\nThe easing of price growth is good news for buyers after a prolonged affordability squeeze caused by soaring prices and high mortgage rates.

Following were Chicago and Cleveland with increases of 5.9 and 4.7 per cent, respectively.\\n\\nPrices in Tampa fell 3.3 per cent, the lowest of the 20 cities measured. Prices in Miami dropped 1.7 per cent.\\n\\n\"Looking ahead, the housing market appears to be finding a new equilibrium after the pandemic boom,\" Nicholas Godec, head of fixed income tradables and commodities at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, said. \"With price growth running at half the rate of inflation and several major markets in decline, the rapid appreciation of recent years has clearly ended.\" BLOOMBERG\\n\\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services</td>\n",

As Singapore's first-generation flats age, the challenge isn't just upkeep but what happens when their 99-year leases expire.\\n\\nEnter Vers, the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme.\\n\\nIn the latest episode of PropertyBT, a podcast of BT Correspondents , host Leslie Yee, examines how Vers might work and whether it can balance fairness, compensation and public trust.\\n\\nVers, due in the 2030s, would let flat owners of about 70-year-old blocks vote on whether to sell their homes back to the Government before leases run out. Unlike the compulsory and highly selective Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (Sers), Vers will be voluntary and far less generous.\\n\\nWhy listen\\n\\nBut what if homeowners say no? Widespread resistance could stall estate renewal, leaving ageing towns hollowed out as leases expire. The alternative coercion or confusion risks shaking confidence in Singapore's housing model.\\n\\nVers isn't just another policy tweak; it's a test of how the city manages ageing homes without eroding its social compact.\\n\\nTune in to PropertyBT for what's at stake and what a graceful exit from a 99-year lease could look like.\\n\\nPropertyBT is a podcast of BT Correspondents .

Chairman Jerome Powell also cautioned investors not to expect more cuts this year.\\n\\nThe drop in borrowing costs, along with a surging stock market, would typically predict a surge in demand, and economists had expected to see a slight increase in pending sales of existing homes last month.\\n\\nThat did not happen: Sales were flat, despite growing inventories, the market blunted by anxieties about tariffs, job security and the ongoing government shutdown.\\n\\nRates are not likely to move much lower \"absent surprisingly slower economic activity\", Realtor.com chief economist Danielle Hale said, noting that the market has already priced in the most recent cut.\\n\\nSEE ALSO\\n\\nEconomic concerns \"could also mean rising rates through the end of the year\", said Bright MLS economist Lisa Sturtevant. \"For prospective buyers who are financially ready, right now could be a sweet spot for lower rates and more inventory\".

       "794  Located in Shenton Way, the project will be the tallest building in Singapore when completed\\n\\nShare\\n\\n[SINGAPORE] A 1,798 square foot Aman-branded residence at The Skywaters complex in Tanjong Pagar has recently changed hands at S$11.7 million or S$6,501 per square foot (psf) – marking a record-high price for a 99-year leasehold property in psf terms.\\n\\nCaveats data showed that the three-bedroom unit on the 30th floor of The Skywaters was bought by a Singapore permanent resident on Oct 8. According to a report by EdgeProp, the buyer is believed to be a Chinese national.\\n\\nLocated in Shenton Way, The Skywaters is a supertall mixed-used project which will be the tallest building in Singapore, developed by a consortium led by Perennial Holdings on the site of the former AXA Tower. Other partners include Alibaba Singapore, Chip Eng Seng, Sing-Haiyi Emerald, Piermont Holdings and HPRY Holdings.\\n\\nThe Aman-branded residence sale came just a week after the luxury hospitality operator announced its debut in Singapore at The Skywaters. Aman suites will occupy the 24th to 26th floors of the complex, with a 44-unit branded residence on the 28th to 30th floors.\\n\\nPrior to the transaction this month, the highest psf price for a 99-year leasehold property was S$6,100 psf for a 7,761 sq ft penthouse unit on the 57th floor of Skywaters Residences, a luxury condominium project located within The Skywaters project. It was bought by a foreigner, whose nationality is not known.\\n\\nTo date, a 3,089 sq ft unit at The Marq on Paterson Hill holds the record for the highest psf transaction at S$6,650 psf, in a sale sealed almost 13 years ago in November 2011.\\n\\nData from URA indicated that Skywaters Residences comprises 146 units on the 31st to 63rd storeys of The Skywaters. Grade A offices are located on the 3rd to 22nd floors. There is also a basement retail mall connected directly to Tanjong Pagar MRT station.\\n\\nThe latest sale comes on the back of improving demand for prime non-landed homes in Singapore, where steep stamp duties have curbed foreign buying since 2023.\\n\\nBased on data compiled by Huttons Asia tracking transactions of large prime location condos priced over S$5 million, 81 such units worth S$740.6 million changed hands in the third quarter of 2025 – up more than 30 per cent in terms of volume, and 30.8 per cent in terms of value quarter on quarter.\\n\\nSEE ALSO\\n\\nIn the first nine months of 2025, a total of 214 luxury non-landed homes worth S$1.9 billion were sold – an increase of 30.5 per cent in volume and 51.3 per cent in value compared with the same period a year ago.\\n\\nSome 13 transactions were valued at S$10 million and higher; among them, two units at 21 Anderson were sold to two PRs for an eye-popping S$52.25 million (S$4,999 psf) each, and a 3,057 sq ft unit in The Marq on Paterson Hill sold to a Swiss national for S$19.2 million or S$6,274 psf.\\n\\n\"The continued geopolitical tensions and uncertainties are driving many ultra-high-net-worth individuals to seek safe havens like Singapore,\" said Huttons Asia chief executive Mark Yip. \"The strong Singapore dollar further makes investing in Singapore an attractive proposition.\"\\n\\nHuttons tracked transactions of non-landed homes larger than 2,000 sq ft in the prime Core Central Region that transacted at S$5 million or more.\\n\\nOn the rental front, around 725 luxury units were leased out in Q3, up 21.6 per cent from the previous quarter.\\n\\nRents held firm, rising a marginal 1.6 per cent to S$15,599 per month. This puts rental growth for the first three quarters of 2025 at more than 10 per cent.\\n\\nYip reckons that the luxury non-landed home market may remain muted in the remaining months of this year, given year-end festivities. \"(But) on a whole, the luxury non-landed homes market is poised for its best performance since 2022,\" he said.\\n\\nCopyright SPH Media.

Economists expected a 1.2 per cent increase, based on the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.\\n\\n\"A record-high stock market and growing housing wealth in September were not enough to offset a likely softening job market,\" NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said. Nonetheless, \"mortgage rates are trending towards three-year lows, which should further improve affordability, though the government shutdown could temporarily slow home sales activity\".\\n\\nEven with middling results for last month, housing economists see the resale market slowly thawing after several years of lacklustre demand. Mortgage rates have shown signs of stabilising below 6.5 per cent, and home prices are cooling.\\n\\nMoreover, the so-called \"lock-in effect\", in which homeowners resist selling because of their existing low-rate mortgages, is waning and helping to boost inventory.\\n\\nFigures out on Tuesday from S&amp;P Cotality Case-Shiller showed buyers are gaining leverage in negotiations with sellers. A national measure of home prices rose 1.5 per cent in August from a year ago, the smallest annual gain since mid-2023.\\n\\nSEE ALSO\\n\\nBy region, contract signings on previously owned homes rose 1.1 per cent in the South to the highest level since March. Pending sales also climbed in the Northeast, while falling in the West and Midwest.\\n\\nThe broader housing market has experienced more momentum recently, with new-home sales surging in August to the highest level since 2022. While some economists chalked up the sharp advance to monthly volatility, builders are using price cuts and sales incentives to drive buyer interest.\\n\\nPending home sales tend to be a leading indicator for previously owned homes, as houses typically go under contract a month or two before they are sold.

According to a report by EdgeProp, the buyer is believed to be a Chinese national.\\n\\nLocated in Shenton Way, The Skywaters is a supertall mixed-used project which will be the tallest building in Singapore, developed by a consortium led by Perennial Holdings on the site of the former AXA Tower. Other partners include Alibaba Singapore, Chip Eng Seng, Sing-Haiyi Emerald, Piermont Holdings and HPRY Holdings.\\n\\nThe Aman-branded residence sale came just a week after the luxury hospitality operator announced its debut in Singapore at The Skywaters. Aman suites will occupy the 24th to 26th floors of the complex, with a 44-unit branded residence on the 28th to 30th floors.\\n\\nPrior to the transaction this month, the highest psf price for a 99-year leasehold property was S$6,100 psf for a 7,761 sq ft penthouse unit on the 57th floor of Skywaters Residences, a luxury condominium project located within The Skywaters project. It was bought by a foreigner, whose nationality is not known.\\n\\nTo date, a 3,089 sq ft unit at The Marq on Paterson Hill holds the record for the highest psf transaction at S$6,650 psf, in a sale sealed almost 13 years ago in November 2011.\\n\\nData from URA indicated that Skywaters Residences comprises 146 units on the 31st to 63rd storeys of The Skywaters. Grade A offices are located on the 3rd to 22nd floors. There is also a basement retail mall connected directly to Tanjong Pagar MRT station.\\n\\nThe latest sale comes on the back of improving demand for prime non-landed homes in Singapore, where steep stamp duties have curbed foreign buying since 2023.\\n\\nBased on data compiled by Huttons Asia tracking transactions of large prime location condos priced over S$5 million, 81 such units worth S$740.6 million changed hands in the third quarter of 2025 – up more than 30 per cent in terms of volume, and 30.8 per cent in terms of value quarter on quarter.\\n\\nSEE ALSO\\n\\nIn the first nine months of 2025, a total of 214 luxury non-landed homes worth S$1.9 billion were sold – an increase of 30.5 per cent in volume and 51.3 per cent in value compared with the same period a year ago.\\n\\nSome 13 transactions were valued at S$10 million and higher; among them, two units at 21 Anderson were sold to two PRs for an eye-popping S$52.25 million (S$4,999 psf) each, and a 3,057 sq ft unit in The Marq on Paterson Hill sold to a Swiss national for S$19.2 million or S$6,274 psf.\\n\\n\"The continued geopolitical tensions and uncertainties are driving many ultra-high-net-worth individuals to seek safe havens like Singapore,\" said Huttons Asia chief executive Mark Yip. \"The strong Singapore dollar further makes investing in Singapore an attractive proposition.\"\\n\\nHuttons tracked transactions of non-landed homes larger than 2,000 sq ft in the prime Core Central Region that transacted at S$5 million or more.\\n\\nOn the rental front, around 725 luxury units were leased out in Q3, up 21.6 per cent from the previous quarter.\\n\\nRents held firm, rising a marginal 1.6 per cent to S$15,599 per month. This puts rental growth for the first three quarters of 2025 at more than 10 per cent.\\n\\nYip reckons that the luxury non-landed home market may remain muted in the remaining months of this year, given year-end festivities. \"(But) on a whole, the luxury non-landed homes market is poised for its best performance since 2022,\" he said.\\n\\nCopyright SPH Media.

Chairman Jerome Powell also cautioned investors not to expect more cuts this year.\\n\\nThe drop in borrowing costs, along with a surging stock market, would typically predict a surge in demand, and economists had expected to see a slight increase in pending sales of existing homes last month.\\n\\nThat did not happen: Sales were flat, despite growing inventories, the market blunted by anxieties about tariffs, job security and the ongoing government shutdown.\\n\\nRates are not likely to move much lower \"absent surprisingly slower economic activity\", Realtor.com chief economist Danielle Hale said, noting that the market has already priced in the most recent cut.\\n\\nSEE ALSO\\n\\nEconomic concerns \"could also mean rising rates through the end of the year\", said Bright MLS economist Lisa Sturtevant. \"For prospective buyers who are financially ready, right now could be a sweet spot for lower rates and more inventory\".

       "2  Located in Shenton Way, the project will be the tallest building in Singapore when completed\\n\\nShare\\n\\n[SINGAPORE] A 1,798 square foot Aman-branded residence at The Skywaters complex in Tanjong Pagar has recently changed hands at S$11.7 million or S$6,501 per square foot (psf) – marking a record-high price for a 99-year leasehold property in psf terms.\\n\\nCaveats data showed that the three-bedroom unit on the 30th floor of The Skywaters was bought by a Singapore permanent resident on Oct 8. According to a report by EdgeProp, the buyer is believed to be a Chinese national.\\n\\nLocated in Shenton Way, The Skywaters is a supertall mixed-used project which will be the tallest building in Singapore, developed by a consortium led by Perennial Holdings on the site of the former AXA Tower. Other partners include Alibaba Singapore, Chip Eng Seng, Sing-Haiyi Emerald, Piermont Holdings and HPRY Holdings.\\n\\nThe Aman-branded residence sale came just a week after the luxury hospitality operator announced its debut in Singapore at The Skywaters. Aman suites will occupy the 24th to 26th floors of the complex, with a 44-unit branded residence on the 28th to 30th floors.\\n\\nPrior to the transaction this month, the highest psf price for a 99-year leasehold property was S$6,100 psf for a 7,761 sq ft penthouse unit on the 57th floor of Skywaters Residences, a luxury condominium project located within The Skywaters project. It was bought by a foreigner, whose nationality is not known.\\n\\nTo date, a 3,089 sq ft unit at The Marq on Paterson Hill holds the record for the highest psf transaction at S$6,650 psf, in a sale sealed almost 13 years ago in November 2011.\\n\\nData from URA indicated that Skywaters Residences comprises 146 units on the 31st to 63rd storeys of The Skywaters. Grade A offices are located on the 3rd to 22nd floors. There is also a basement retail mall connected directly to Tanjong Pagar MRT station.\\n\\nThe latest sale comes on the back of improving demand for prime non-landed homes in Singapore, where steep stamp duties have curbed foreign buying since 2023.\\n\\nBased on data compiled by Huttons Asia tracking transactions of large prime location condos priced over S$5 million, 81 such units worth S$740.6 million changed hands in the third quarter of 2025 – up more than 30 per cent in terms of volume, and 30.8 per cent in terms of value quarter on quarter.\\n\\nSEE ALSO\\n\\nIn the first nine months of 2025, a total of 214 luxury non-landed homes worth S$1.9 billion were sold – an increase of 30.5 per cent in volume and 51.3 per cent in value compared with the same period a year ago.\\n\\nSome 13 transactions were valued at S$10 million and higher; among them, two units at 21 Anderson were sold to two PRs for an eye-popping S$52.25 million (S$4,999 psf) each, and a 3,057 sq ft unit in The Marq on Paterson Hill sold to a Swiss national for S$19.2 million or S$6,274 psf.\\n\\n\"The continued geopolitical tensions and uncertainties are driving many ultra-high-net-worth individuals to seek safe havens like Singapore,\" said Huttons Asia chief executive Mark Yip. \"The strong Singapore dollar further makes investing in Singapore an attractive proposition.\"\\n\\nHuttons tracked transactions of non-landed homes larger than 2,000 sq ft in the prime Core Central Region that transacted at S$5 million or more.\\n\\nOn the rental front, around 725 luxury units were leased out in Q3, up 21.6 per cent from the previous quarter.\\n\\nRents held firm, rising a marginal 1.6 per cent to S$15,599 per month. This puts rental growth for the first three quarters of 2025 at more than 10 per cent.\\n\\nYip reckons that the luxury non-landed home market may remain muted in the remaining months of this year, given year-end festivities. \"(But) on a whole, the luxury non-landed homes market is poised for its best performance since 2022,\" he said.\\n\\nCopyright SPH Media.

      "Share\\n\\nSingaporeans have always had a special interest in real estate investment so GuocoLand's recent success in Lentor might have piqued your interest. It certainly piqued Leslie Yee's interest.\\n\\nAs host of The Business Times podcast PropertyBT, he sat down with Dora Chng, residential director at GuocoLand to garner insights into their residential developments in the latest podcast episode.\\n\\nUnearth market trends and insights\\n\\nThe pair explore why new condo units in Singapore are commanding high prices and selling like hotcakes. With Chng's expert insights, listeners gain a comprehensive understanding of the unique appeal and advantages of owning a brand-new condo compared to resale properties. This episode is packed with data and observations that can help potential buyers and investors make informed decisions.\\n\\nShe explains the intrinsic value and attraction of new condos, such as modern designs, fresh tenure, and state-of-the-art facilities. She also points out that new developments often integrate leisure and practical amenities, making them highly desirable.\\n\\nPricing premium justification\\n\\nDespite the higher price point of new condos—40 per cent higher on average compared to resale units—Chng explains why these properties are worth the investment. She proposes that enhanced facilities, strategic locations near MRT stations, and flexible, contemporary layouts are key reasons.\\n\\nThe conversation then delves into GuocoLand's successful projects in the Lentor area, illustrating how the company has innovatively marketed and sold multiple developments despite a competitive landscape. Here again Chng shares insights into their strategic approach which offers valuable lessons for real estate professionals and investors.\\n\\nEvolving buyer preferences\\n\\nSEE ALSO\\n\\nYee and Chng move on to discuss how buyer preferences are shifting, with modern buyers valuing location convenience and flexible living spaces. Chng highlights the changing demographics and needs of condo buyers in Singapore, ensuring that listeners are up-to-date with current market trends.\\n\\nThe podcast shines a light on GuocoLand's forward-thinking projects that emphasise wellness and sustainability. Chng then shares intriguing details about the upcoming Spring Leaf Residence, designed to coexist harmoniously with its natural surroundings—an increasingly important factor for environmentally conscious buyers. A definite highlight for listeners who might be considering a property purchase.\\n\\nShow flats vs virtual walkthroughs\\n\\nThe episode covers the enduring importance of show flats in an age of advanced virtual reality technology. Here Chng provides practical advice on what to look for in show flats, offering essential tips for potential buyers to visualise their future homes accurately.\\n\\nListen now to this candid discussion, between Leslie Yee of The Business Times and Dora Chng from GuocoLand which addresses common concerns about the timing of property purchases and financial planning. Useful advice whether you are a prospective buyer for investment or looking for a home.\\n\\nPropertyBT is a podcast of BT Correspondents.
