This is where home owners pay for a property according to the stage of construction it is at.\\n\\nEngineer Emilia Wong sold her five-room, 110 sq m flat in Taman Jurong for $570,000 after it reached the five-year point in August 2019. She upgraded to a $1.4 million 95 sq m three-bedder at Le Quest condo last July, a move delayed by a few months because of the circuit breaker.\\n\\n\"We downsized a little, but the condo has a lot of amenities, including a community mall, and our kids love swimming a lot. So, if we can afford Le Quest, why not?\" said Ms Wong, 36, who is married with three children.\\n\\nShe and her civil servant husband Md Faizal Salim pay a monthly loan instalment of almost $4,000 for the apartment, after making a 20 per cent down payment with their savings. They bought a new condo unit as they believe the potential for capital appreciation is higher than resale units.\\n\\n\"We wanted to live in the west because our parents live in Jurong and our kids study in schools there. I am working in Tuas and my husband works at Jurong Island,\" she said.\\n\\nThe couple had considered Whistler Grand and Parc Clematis, but chose Le Quest as it was near completion last year.\\n\\nHowever, fewer property launches are expected this year.\\n\\nMost mega-projects have already been launched in the past two years, said Ms Sun. In addition, the projects stemming from the spate of aggressive land deals in 2017 and 2018 are nearing the peak and are expected to taper off from next year, she added.\\n\\nIS THE SITUATION SUSTAINABLE?\\n\\nAnalysts said the gap in suburban home prices is unsustainable as resales may start to look appealing to cost-conscious buyers.\\n\\nA case in point, the prices of new launches in the prime or core central region began to drop last year after the gap widened to as much as 47 per cent in 2018, said Ms Tricia Song, head of research (Singapore) for Colliers International.\\n\\nSo, the same trend may be seen in suburban private property.\\n\\n\"The widening gap indicates resales could represent more value for money on a per square foot basis, so I think more demand will shift to resale homes,\" said Ms Song.\\n\\nThe resale market could also see more interest if the collective sale market starts to stir as developers are looking to acquire land in the face of dwindling unsold inventory, said Mr Wong.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the price differential in prime areas has grown narrower, as foreigner buying, particularly in the luxury market, slumped to a 17-year low last year due to global travel restrictions and lockdowns.\\n\\nThe gap between new and resale prices in prime districts narrowed to 37.7 per cent last year from 45.8 per cent in 2019 and 47.2 per cent in 2018, said Mr Mak.\\n\\nMedian prices of new prime district homes sold by developers fell 7.6 per cent last year from 2019, faster than the drop in resale prices over the same period, he added.\\n\\nNevertheless, mainland Chinese remained the top foreign buyers of new non-landed homes in Singapore last year.\\n\\nSome of these buyers may have diverted their funds to property to combat the devaluation of the Chinese renminbi amid the ongoing economic crisis.\\n\\nTo many Chinese investors, property in Singapore is highly attractive in terms of the potential for capital appreciation, Ms Sun said.\\n\\nWhile demand in the overall resale market is good, some owners have difficulty selling due to other issues.\\n\\nPropNex agent Kelvin Tan, who has been marketing a two-bedder at SunGlade in Serangoon since January last year at $1.05 million, said the condo unit's owner has received four offers so far for the 861 sq ft leasehold unit.\\n\\n\"The offers came in at $950,000, $980,000. We also had an offer at $1.02 million in February last year, but the buyer had problems selling his flat, so we couldn't close (the deal),\" he added.\\n\\n\"Just two weeks ago, we got an offer of $1.03 million from someone buying for his own stay,\" Mr Tan said.\\n\\nBut the condo unit's owner, a self-employed businessman, is now in a bind because his condo tenant wants to renew the lease for one more year.\\n\\n\"So for now, the owner can sell only to investors,\" Mr Tan added.\\n\\nSwipe.

In addition, the projects stemming from the spate of aggressive land deals in 2017 and 2018 are nearing the peak and are expected to taper off from next year, she added.\\n\\nIs the situation sustainable?\\n\\nAnalysts said the gap in suburban home prices is unsustainable as resales may start to look appealing to cost-conscious buyers.\\n\\nA case in point, the prices of new launches in the prime or core central region began to drop last year after the gap widened to as much as 47 per cent in 2018, said Ms Tricia Song, head of research (Singapore) for Colliers International.\\n\\nSo, the same trend may be seen in suburban private property.\\n\\n\"The widening gap indicates resales could represent more value for money on a per square foot basis, so I think more demand will shift to resale homes,\" said Ms Song.\\n\\nThe resale market could also see more interest if the collective sale market starts to stir as developers are looking to acquire land in the face of dwindling unsold inventory, said Mr Wong.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the price differential in prime areas has grown narrower, as foreigner buying, particularly in the luxury market, slumped to a 17-year low last year due to global travel restrictions and lockdowns.\\n\\nThe gap between new and resale prices in prime districts narrowed to 37.7 per cent last year from 45.8 per cent in 2019 and 47.2 per cent in 2018, said Mr Mak.\\n\\nMedian prices of new prime district homes sold by developers fell 7.6 per cent last year from 2019, faster than the drop in resale prices over the same period, he added.\\n\\nNevertheless, mainland Chinese remained the top foreign buyers of new non-landed homes in Singapore last year.\\n\\nSome of these buyers may have diverted their funds to property to combat the devaluation of the Chinese renminbi amid the ongoing economic crisis.\\n\\nTo many Chinese investors, property in Singapore is highly attractive in terms of the potential for capital appreciation, Ms Sun said.\\n\\nWhile demand in the overall resale market is good, some owners have difficulty selling due to other issues.\\n\\nPropNex agent Kelvin Tan, who has been marketing a two-bedder at SunGlade in Serangoon since January last year at $1.05 million, said the condo unit's owner has received four offers so far for the 861 sq ft leasehold unit.\\n\\n\"The offers came in at $950,000, $980,000. We also had an offer at $1.02 million in February last year, but the buyer had problems selling his flat, so we couldn't close (the deal),\" he added.\\n\\n\"Just two weeks ago, we got an offer of $1.03 million from someone buying for his own stay,\" Mr Tan said.\\n\\nBut the condo unit's owner, a self-employed businessman, is now in a bind because his condo tenant wants to renew the lease for one more year.\\n\\n\"So for now, the owner can sell only to investors,\" Mr Tan added.\\n\\nSwipe.

       "      <td>SINGAPORE - More homes will be improved with better facilities and fittings, with a second batch of about 230,000 Housing Board flats built between 1987 and 1997 eligible for the Home Improvement Programme (HIP).\\n\\nUpgrading works will start first for about 56,000 flats from this group, the HDB said on Sunday (Feb 20).\\n\\nAbout two-thirds of the affected households have been asked if they want to proceed with HIP, since polling began in September 2021.\\n\\nAs at Dec 31 last year, all polled blocks had at least 75 per cent of eligible households voting in favour of the HIP - a pre-requisite before works can start. The start of works for the expanded HIP scheme, 15 years after the programme was launched in 2007, comes as HIP works for almost all the first batch of 320,000 eligible flats built before 1986 are reaching completion.\\n\\nOf this group, about 81 per cent - about 259,100 flats - have completed upgrading works, while another 17 per cent - about 55,100 flats - are in various stages of upgrading, said HDB.\\n\\nAs at March 31 last year, the Government has spent about $3.4 billion on the improvement works for the first batch of flats. The enhancements aim to improve the quality of life for HDB residents, take care of common maintenance problems and address issues related to an ageing population.\\n\\nThe programme has three components - essential improvement items, optional items and enhancements for active seniors (Ease).\\n\\nThe essential improvements, such as repair of spalling concrete or structural cracks, and installation of a retractable clothes drying rack, enhance public health and safety standards and are fully paid for by the Government.\\n\\nOptional improvement items, such as new entrance doors and gates, are subsidised up to 95 per cent depending on flat type.\\n\\nThe Ease programme, also heavily subsidised, provides elderly-friendly fittings for the homes, such as grab bars, ramps and slip-resistant treatment to toilet floor tiles.\\n\\nThese fittings are also offered separately under a direct application route for residents who need them, or whose blocks do not qualify for HIP.\\n\\nTo enable residents to visualise how the Ease fittings will look in their homes, HDB has introduced an augmented reality feature on the Mobile@HDB app since last July.\\n\\nUsing their digital devices, residents can scan their home with the app, and virtually place and adjust the selected type of grab bars on the walls, or ramps on the floors.\\n\\nHDB said that more than 255,500 households have applied for Ease, which began in 2012, as at Dec 31 last year.\\n\\nOf these, about 160,200 opted for it together with the HIP while 95,300 used the direct application route.\\n\\nThe Government has spent about $102 million on Ease as at March 31 last year, said HDB.\\n\\nEase was expanded to include ramp solutions for flats with multi-step entrances in December 2018.\\n\\nThese have been installed in more than 3,000 homes as at Dec 31 last year.\\n\\nOf these, about 1,940 customised ramps and 1,070 portable ramps were installed.\\n\\nAbout 2,080 ramps were installed in homes that had applied directly for Ease. The remaining 930 ramps were installed under Ease as part of HIP works.\\n\\nFor Mr Chua Soo Eng's family, whose upgrades to their four-room flat at Chua Chu Kang were completed on Jan 7 after 10 days of works, the improvements have helped.\\n\\nHe moved in more than 20 years ago and lives with his wife, 57, a housewife, their 26-year old son and 24-year old daughter. They decided to upgrade both toilets in the flat with new wall and floor tiles, a toilet bowl, a basin and a grab bar.\\n\\nMr Chua, 57, a businessman in the food and beverage industry, said the toilet now looks much neater and bigger owing to a rearrangement of pipes.\\n\\nBefore the upgrade, the toilet wall had small tiles that were 15cm by 15cm. Some of the fillings in the crevices had fallen off while some tiles had cracked. It \"looked disgusting and was difficult to wash\", he said.\\n\\nThe new toilet bowl is also more water-efficient as it requires less flushing than the old one, which had also started to show crack lines, he added.\\n\\nThe family also opted for a new metal gate for the entrance to their home, with one side of the gate larger than the other. Their old gate had both sides of equal size, which was more inconvenient when carrying large boxes, for example, as both sides then had to be opened, said Mr Chua.\\n\\n\"Overall, the whole family is very happy with it. The 10 days of 'suffering' was all worth it,\" he quipped.\\n\\nSwipe. Select.

In addition, the projects stemming from the spate of aggressive land deals in 2017 and 2018 are nearing the peak and are expected to taper off from next year, she added.\\n\\nIS THE SITUATION SUSTAINABLE?\\n\\nAnalysts said the gap in suburban home prices is unsustainable as resales may start to look appealing to cost-conscious buyers.\\n\\nA case in point, the prices of new launches in the prime or core central region began to drop last year after the gap widened to as much as 47 per cent in 2018, said Ms Tricia Song, head of research (Singapore) for Colliers International.\\n\\nSo, the same trend may be seen in suburban private property.\\n\\n\"The widening gap indicates resales could represent more value for money on a per square foot basis, so I think more demand will shift to resale homes,\" said Ms Song.\\n\\nThe resale market could also see more interest if the collective sale market starts to stir as developers are looking to acquire land in the face of dwindling unsold inventory, said Mr Wong.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the price differential in prime areas has grown narrower, as foreigner buying, particularly in the luxury market, slumped to a 17-year low last year due to global travel restrictions and lockdowns.\\n\\nThe gap between new and resale prices in prime districts narrowed to 37.7 per cent last year from 45.8 per cent in 2019 and 47.2 per cent in 2018, said Mr Mak.\\n\\nMedian prices of new prime district homes sold by developers fell 7.6 per cent last year from 2019, faster than the drop in resale prices over the same period, he added.\\n\\nNevertheless, mainland Chinese remained the top foreign buyers of new non-landed homes in Singapore last year.\\n\\nSome of these buyers may have diverted their funds to property to combat the devaluation of the Chinese renminbi amid the ongoing economic crisis.\\n\\nTo many Chinese investors, property in Singapore is highly attractive in terms of the potential for capital appreciation, Ms Sun said.\\n\\nWhile demand in the overall resale market is good, some owners have difficulty selling due to other issues.\\n\\nPropNex agent Kelvin Tan, who has been marketing a two-bedder at SunGlade in Serangoon since January last year at $1.05 million, said the condo unit's owner has received four offers so far for the 861 sq ft leasehold unit.\\n\\n\"The offers came in at $950,000, $980,000.

This is where home owners pay for a property according to the stage of construction it is at.\\n\\nEngineer Emilia Wong sold her five-room, 110 sq m flat in Taman Jurong for $570,000 after it reached the five-year point in August 2019. She upgraded to a $1.4 million 95 sq m three-bedder at Le Quest condo last July, a move delayed by a few months because of the circuit breaker.\\n\\n\"We downsized a little, but the condo has a lot of amenities, including a community mall, and our kids love swimming a lot. So, if we can afford Le Quest, why not?\" said Ms Wong, 36, who is married with three children.\\n\\nShe and her civil servant husband Md Faizal Salim pay a monthly loan instalment of almost $4,000 for the apartment, after making a 20 per cent down payment with their savings. They bought a new condo unit as they believe the potential for capital appreciation is higher than resale units.\\n\\n\"We wanted to live in the west because our parents live in Jurong and our kids study in schools there. I am working in Tuas and my husband works at Jurong Island,\" she said.\\n\\nThe couple had considered Whistler Grand and Parc Clematis, but chose Le Quest as it was near completion last year.\\n\\nHowever, fewer property launches are expected this year.\\n\\nMost mega-projects have already been launched in the past two years, said Ms Sun. In addition, the projects stemming from the spate of aggressive land deals in 2017 and 2018 are nearing the peak and are expected to taper off from next year, she added.\\n\\nIs the situation sustainable?\\n\\nAnalysts said the gap in suburban home prices is unsustainable as resales may start to look appealing to cost-conscious buyers.\\n\\nA case in point, the prices of new launches in the prime or core central region began to drop last year after the gap widened to as much as 47 per cent in 2018, said Ms Tricia Song, head of research (Singapore) for Colliers International.\\n\\nSo, the same trend may be seen in suburban private property.\\n\\n\"The widening gap indicates resales could represent more value for money on a per square foot basis, so I think more demand will shift to resale homes,\" said Ms Song.\\n\\nThe resale market could also see more interest if the collective sale market starts to stir as developers are looking to acquire land in the face of dwindling unsold inventory, said Mr Wong.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the price differential in prime areas has grown narrower, as foreigner buying, particularly in the luxury market, slumped to a 17-year low last year due to global travel restrictions and lockdowns.\\n\\nThe gap between new and resale prices in prime districts narrowed to 37.7 per cent last year from 45.8 per cent in 2019 and 47.2 per cent in 2018, said Mr Mak.\\n\\nMedian prices of new prime district homes sold by developers fell 7.6 per cent last year from 2019, faster than the drop in resale prices over the same period, he added.\\n\\nNevertheless, mainland Chinese remained the top foreign buyers of new non-landed homes in Singapore last year.\\n\\nSome of these buyers may have diverted their funds to property to combat the devaluation of the Chinese renminbi amid the ongoing economic crisis.\\n\\nTo many Chinese investors, property in Singapore is highly attractive in terms of the potential for capital appreciation, Ms Sun said.\\n\\nWhile demand in the overall resale market is good, some owners have difficulty selling due to other issues.\\n\\nPropNex agent Kelvin Tan, who has been marketing a two-bedder at SunGlade in Serangoon since January last year at $1.05 million, said the condo unit's owner has received four offers so far for the 861 sq ft leasehold unit.\\n\\n\"The offers came in at $950,000, $980,000. We also had an offer at $1.02 million in February last year, but the buyer had problems selling his flat, so we couldn't close (the deal),\" he added.\\n\\n\"Just two weeks ago, we got an offer of $1.03 million from someone buying for his own stay,\" Mr Tan said.\\n\\nBut the condo unit's owner, a self-employed businessman, is now in a bind because his condo tenant wants to renew the lease for one more year.\\n\\n\"So for now, the owner can sell only to investors,\" Mr Tan added.\\n\\nSwipe.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           More than 540,000 Housing Board flat owners will, on average, pay 10 per cent less in premiums for a Central Provident Fund (CPF) home insurance scheme from July 1.\\n\\nThe CPF Board said yesterday that it would be reducing premiums for the Home Protection Scheme (HPS) owing to \"better-than-expected investment returns and claims experience\".\\n\\nThe scheme protects CPF members and their families from the risk of losing their HDB flats in the event of death, terminal illness or total permanent disability before their housing loans are paid up.\\n\\nLast year, $83.8 million was paid out in claims to home owners who were insured under HPS.\\n\\nThe last time a reduction in premiums for the scheme was made was in 2018.\\n\\nThe CPF Board said it conducts periodic reviews to ensure that HPS premiums remain affordable, while maintaining the long-term sustainability of the HPS fund.\\n\\nThe new rates will kick in for members who join the scheme on or after July 1, while existing members will pay the lower prices when they pay their annual premium or adjust their coverage on or after July 1.\\n\\nFor example, a male member aged 36 with a $200,000 housing loan from the HDB for 30 years will pay a reduced annual premium of $209.40 instead of $232.40 - equivalent to a 10 per cent reduction - when he joins the scheme from July 1, said the CPF Board.\\n\\n\"The reduction in insurance premiums will help with my family's housing finances in the long term - a penny saved is a penny earned,\" said Ms Peggy Lim, 34, a logistics executive who is a first-time flat owner.\\n\\nCPF members who are using their CPF savings to pay for their housing loans have to be insured under HPS, said the CPF Board.\\n\\nThose not using CPF savings to pay for their housing loans can also apply for the insurance.\\n\\nFrom next month, potential home buyers can use the HPS calculator on the CPF website to estimate their new premiums.\\n\\nFor more

                                       SINGAPORE - More than 540,000 Housing Board (HDB) flat owners will, on average, pay 10 per cent less in premiums for a Central Provident Fund (CPF) home insurance scheme from July 1.\\n\\nThe CPF Board on Thursday (June 24) said it is reducing premiums for the Home Protection Scheme (HPS) \"due to better-than-expected investment returns and claims experience\".\\n\\nThe scheme protects CPF members and their families from the risk of losing their HDB flats in the event of death, terminal illness, or total permanent disability before their housing loans are paid up.\\n\\nLast year, $83.8 million was paid out in claims to home owners insured under HPS.\\n\\nThe last time a reduction in premiums for the scheme was made was in 2018.\\n\\nPeriodic reviews are conducted by the CPF Board to ensure that HPS premiums remain affordable, while maintaining the long-term sustainability of the HPS fund, said the CPF.\\n\\nThe new rates will kick in for members who join the scheme on or after July 1, while existing members will pay the lower prices when they pay their annual premium or adjust their coverage on or after July 1.\\n\\nFor example, a male member aged 36 with a $200,000 housing loan from HDB for 30 years will pay a reduced annual premium of $209.40 instead of $232.40 - equivalent to a 10 per cent reduction - when he joins the scheme from July 1 this year, said the CPF.\\n\\n\"The reduction in insurance premiums will help with my family's housing finances in the long term - a penny saved is a penny earned,\" said Ms Peggy Lim, 34, a logistics executive who is a first-time flat owner.\\n\\nCPF members who are using CPF savings to pay for their housing loans have to be insured under HPS, said the CPF.\\n\\nThose not using their CPF savings to pay for their housing loans can also apply for the insurance.\\n\\nFrom next month, potential home buyers can use the HPS calculator on the CPF website

The start of works for the expanded HIP scheme, 15 years after the programme was launched in 2007, comes as HIP works for almost all the first batch of 320,000 eligible flats built before 1986 are reaching completion.\\n\\nOf this group, about 81 per cent - about 259,100 flats - have completed upgrading works, while another 17 per cent - about 55,100 flats - are in various stages of upgrading, said HDB.\\n\\nAs at March 31 last year, the Government has spent about $3.4 billion on the improvement works for the first batch of flats. The enhancements aim to improve the quality of life for HDB residents, take care of common maintenance problems and address issues related to an ageing population.\\n\\nThe programme has three components - essential improvement items, optional items and enhancements for active seniors (Ease).\\n\\nThe essential improvements, such as repair of spalling concrete or structural cracks, and installation of a retractable clothes drying rack, enhance public health and safety standards and are fully paid for by the Government.\\n\\nOptional improvement items, such as new entrance doors and gates, are subsidised up to 95 per cent depending on flat type.\\n\\nThe Ease programme, also heavily subsidised, provides elderly-friendly fittings for the homes, such as grab bars, ramps and slip-resistant treatment to toilet floor tiles.\\n\\nThese fittings are also offered separately under a direct application route for residents who need them, or whose blocks do not qualify for HIP.\\n\\nTo enable residents to visualise how the Ease fittings will look in their homes, HDB has introduced an augmented reality feature on the Mobile@HDB app since last July.\\n\\nUsing their digital devices, residents can scan their home with the app, and virtually place and adjust the selected type of grab bars on the walls, or ramps on the floors.\\n\\nHDB said that more than 255,500 households have applied for Ease, which began in 2012, as at Dec 31 last year.\\n\\nOf these, about 160,200 opted for it together with the HIP while 95,300 used the direct application route.\\n\\nThe Government has spent about $102 million on Ease as at March 31 last year, said HDB.\\n\\nEase was expanded to include ramp solutions for flats with multi-step entrances in December 2018.\\n\\nThese have been installed in more than 3,000 homes as at Dec 31 last year.\\n\\nOf these, about 1,940 customised ramps and 1,070 portable ramps were installed.\\n\\nAbout 2,080 ramps were installed in homes that had applied directly for Ease. The remaining 930 ramps were installed under Ease as part of HIP works.\\n\\nFor Mr Chua Soo Eng's family, whose upgrades to their four-room flat at Chua Chu Kang were completed on Jan 7 after 10 days of works, the improvements have helped.\\n\\nHe moved in more than 20 years ago and lives with his wife, 57, a housewife, their 26-year old son and 24-year old daughter. They decided to upgrade both toilets in the flat with new wall and floor tiles, a toilet bowl, a basin and a grab bar.\\n\\nMr Chua, 57, a businessman in the food and beverage industry, said the toilet now looks much neater and bigger owing to a rearrangement of pipes.\\n\\nBefore the upgrade, the toilet wall had small tiles that were 15cm by 15cm. Some of the fillings in the crevices had fallen off while some tiles had cracked. It \"looked disgusting and was difficult to wash\", he said.\\n\\nThe new toilet bowl is also more water-efficient as it requires less flushing than the old one, which had also started to show crack lines, he added.\\n\\nThe family also opted for a new metal gate for the entrance to their home, with one side of the gate larger than the other. Their old gate had both sides of equal size, which was more inconvenient when carrying large boxes, for example, as both sides then had to be opened, said Mr Chua.\\n\\n\"Overall, the whole family is very happy with it. The 10 days of 'suffering' was all worth it,\" he quipped.\\n\\nSwipe. Select.

Anchorvale Village in Sengkang - has exceeded the legal completion date, and buyers will be compensated by the Housing Board.\\n\\nThe project, which has 207 units across two blocks, is now expected to be finished between May and July next year, which is a delay of about four to six months beyond the delivery possession date - the legal contractual date by which HDB is required to hand over the keys.\\n\\nIn response to queries from The Straits Times, HDB said all buyers will receive the maximum reimbursement sum that they are eligible for, without needing to submit any claims.\\n\\nOf the 207 two-room flexi and three-room units, 200 have been booked.\\n\\nThe buyers can expect to be reimbursed between $2,270 and $6,360, based on current estimates of the delay, in a one-off payment about two months after key collection, said HDB.\\n\\nThose who get their keys in May 2023 will get between $2,270 and $4,240, while those who get theirs in July 2023 will receive between $3,400 and $6,360.\\n\\nAnchorvale Village was originally slated for completion in the first quarter of this year when it was launched for sale in November 2017.\\n\\nFactoring in the fresh delays, this brings the total waiting time to about 5.2 years, or about 62 months.\\n\\nThe first BTO project to exceed its delivery possession date was Waterway Sunrise II in Punggol, which has 1,014 units across seven blocks, after its then main contractor ran into financial difficulties and had to cease operations.\\n\\nOf the 98 BTO projects currently under construction, Anchorvale Village and Waterway Sunrise II are the only two to have incurred a delay of more than one year and exceeded their delivery possession date, said HDB.\\n\\nDelays for most BTO projects have been kept to between six and 12 months, after government support and assistance measures were rolled out, said HDB.\\n\\nIt told ST that Anchorvale Village faces significant challenges that have impacted its construction progress more compared with the other delayed BTO projects.\\n\\nFor instance, the project, which is integrated with a neighbourhood centre, is located on a built-up site surrounded by existing developments.\\n\\nThe site along Anchorvale Road sits across the road from Sengkang Riverside Park and Sengkang Sports Centre.\\n\\n\"The tight construction site and more complex design with the integration of commercial and residential components posed additional constraints and challenges,\" said HDB.\\n\\nChallenges from the pandemic also hurt progress.\\n\\nThe main contractor Ken-Pal had just begun work on the basement carpark when all construction work had to be halted during the two-month circuit breaker in 2020.\\n\\nWhen work resumed, progress was impeded by manpower and material shortages, as well as the stringent Covid-19 safe management measures at the work site.\\n\\nIn December 2020, buyers were informed of a nine-month delay, with completion pushed to the fourth quarter of 2022.\\n\\nProgress on the super-structural phase of construction - the portion of a building that is constructed above ground level - was also hindered by frequent rain in March and April this year and operational hurdles.\\n\\nHDB said it conducted a detailed evaluation of the project's progress and timelines last month, and assessed that it will no longer be possible to complete work by the delivery possession date of Jan 31, 2023.\\n\\nFlat buyers were notified of the fresh delays earlier this month via e-mails and letters sent by HDB and seen by ST.\\n\\nTrade finance officer Jasmine Goh, 26, who bought a three-room unit in Anchorvale Village with her fiance, said the delay did not come as a surprise, based on the work progress they had observed in the past year.\\n\\n\"We compared the progress of our project with our friend's BTO project that has the same completion period, and ours seemed to be lagging behind,\" she added.\\n\\nMs Goh, who is expecting her first child at the year end, has applied to HDB for a rental flat while waiting for her new home.\\n\\n\"At one point, we did consider cancelling our BTO flat purchase because of the long wait, but we eventually decided not to.

The project is expected to be completed six to nine months after its delivery possession date in May to June this year.\\n\\nOf the 98 BTO projects currently under construction, Anchorvale Village and Waterway Sunrise II are the only two to have incurred a delay of more than one year and exceeded their delivery possession date, said HDB.\\n\\nDelays for most BTO projects are kept to between six and 12 months after government support and assistance measures are rolled out, said HDB.\\n\\nIt told ST that Anchorvale Village faces significant challenges that have impacted its construction progress more than the other delayed BTO projects.\\n\\nFor instance, the project, which is integrated with a neighbourhood centre, is located on a built-up site surrounded by existing developments.\\n\\nThe site along Anchorvale Road sits across the road from Sengkang Riverside Park and Sengkang Sports Centre.\\n\\n\"The tight construction site and more complex design with the integration of commercial and residential components posed additional constraints and challenges,\" said HDB.\\n\\nChallenges from the pandemic also hurt progress.\\n\\nThe main contractor Ken-Pal had just begun work on the basement carpark when all construction work had to be halted during the two-month circuit breaker in 2020.\\n\\nWhen work resumed, progress was impeded by manpower and material shortages, as well as the stringent Covid-19 safe management measures at the worksite.\\n\\nIn December 2020, buyers were informed of a nine-month delay, with the completion pushed to the fourth quarter of 2022.\\n\\nLast year, HDB said it continued to assist Ken-Pal through advance payments, co-sharing of costs, workforce recruitment and other measures, even as Covid-19-related challenges such as Malaysia's movement control order and tightened supply of workers from South Asia continued to pose obstacles.\\n\\n\"The project was able to make some headway between the end of 2021 and early 2022, and largely managed to keep to the progress milestones during those few months,\" said HDB.\\n\\nHowever, progress on the superstructural phase of construction - the portion of a building that is constructed above ground level - was hindered by frequent rain in March and April this year and operational hurdles.\\n\\n\"The pace of the precast lifting and installation works in this phase was significantly constrained by the tight construction area, which was surrounded by existing developments, with access restriction for heavy vehicles and equipment,\" said HDB.\\n\\nIt added that it conducted a detailed evaluation of the project's progress and timelines last month, and assessed that it will no longer be possible to complete work by the delivery possession date of Jan 31, 2023.\\n\\nFlat buyers were notified of the fresh delays earlier this month via e-mails and letters sent by HDB and seen by ST.\\n\\nTrade finance officer Jasmine Goh, 26, who bought a three-room unit in Anchorvale Village with her fiance, said the delay did not come as a surprise based on the work progress they observed in the past year.\\n\\n\"We compared the progress of our project with our friend's BTO project that has the same completion period, and ours seemed to be lagging behind,\" she added.\\n\\nMs Goh, who is expecting her first child at the year end, has applied to HDB for a rental flat while waiting for her new home.\\n\\n\"At one point, we did consider cancelling our BTO flat purchase because of the long wait, but we eventually decided not to. Because of our... age, we can still afford to wait,\" she said.\\n\\nThe construction industry has been one of the worst-hit sectors amid the pandemic, with many firms grappling with higher costs and manpower shortages over the last two years.\\n\\nWith borders reopening and more workers entering Singapore, HDB said manpower constraints have eased significantly in recent months, with almost all BTO sites nearing full manpower capacity.\\n\\nHowever, HDB said there are still some uncertainties such as the Ukraine-Russia conflict and the Covid-19 situation in China, which may impact material prices and further disrupt the global supply chain.\\n\\n\"We're monitoring these developments very closely and have been responding as appropriate to better support our contractors and suppliers,\" said HDB.\\n\\n\"With the improving Covid-19 situation and more positive outlook in the construction industry, HDB will strive to make further progress to minimise delays and deliver new BTO flats to buyers as soon as possible.\"\\n\\nThis month, about 5,300 BTO flats in towns such as Bukit Merah, Jurong West, Ghim Moh estate in Queenstown, Toa Payoh and Yishun will be launched for sale.\\n\\nSwipe.

      "The water tank on an Ang Mo Kio block where the tap water was found to have trace amounts of hydrocarbon - the kind of compounds used in anti-mosquito oil - was not tampered with.\\n\\nBut investigations are continuing to determine how the hydrocarbons got into the tank located on the rooftop, Ang Mo Kio Town Council (AMKTC) said yesterday.\\n\\nThe tank is connected to a ground-floor drain where anti-mosquito oiling is done, via a discharge pipe.\\n\\nThe town council will work with the authorities to review the piping system to the water tank, its spokesman said, without elaborating.\\n\\nIt has also submitted a sample of its anti-mosquito oil to national water agency PUB for testing to see if the constituents match those of the hydrocarbons found by the agency.\\n\\nThe spokesman added: \"Upon being alerted to (the issue) on Jan 13, we immediately checked the locks to the rooftop access and the water tanks and these were not tampered with.\\n\\n\"We have already conducted thorough inspections on the water tanks in nearby blocks and will also be cleaning the outlets of the discharge pipes as well. We did not find anything that was out of the ordinary during these inspections.\"\\n\\nA resident living on the sixth floor of Block 635 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6 had told PUB on Jan 13 that his tap water gave off an oil-like odour.\\n\\nPUB said on Friday that while its tests showed the water quality from the mains was good, the tap points contained trace amounts of hydrocarbons.\\n\\nHydrocarbons - compounds made of carbon and hydrogen - are the main components of petroleum and crude oil.\\n\\nThe town council flushed the block's rooftop water tanks, which supply water to flats from the sixth to the 12th floors, after the incident. It also hired a plumber to wash and chlorinate the water tanks to remove any remaining traces of hydrocarbons.\\n\\nPUB provided residents with water bags during the flushing and cleaning operations, which disrupted water supply to flats.\\n\\nThe agency had said on Friday the block's water supply was monitored in the subsequent days and its quality at tap point has returned to normal.\\n\\nIt has also issued circulars warning that spraying insecticides too close to storage tanks during fogging operations can affect the quality of the water inside.\\n\\n\\n\\nBusiness\n"
